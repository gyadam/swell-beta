# SwellBeta
Rock climbing condition forecast app for Ocean Beach and Black Sands Beach

SwellBeta is an app I created to enable users to view tide levels and swell heights for two popular beaches in the SF Bay Area (Ocean Beach and Black Sands Beach). Both beaches have rock climbing areas which are water level dependant, and the app makes it very easy to check if the conditions are ideal to go rock climbing.

The app pulls data from the following APIs:
- [Magicseaweed](https://magicseaweed.com/) (swell height and weather data)
- [Tide API](https://rapidapi.com/apihood/api/tides) (tide data)

SwellBeta was built in Android Studio using Flutter and Dart, and deployed to a Samsung A20 smartphone.
