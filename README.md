# SwellBeta
Swell forecast app for Black Sands Beach, CA

SwellBeta is an app I created to enable users to view tide levels and swell heights for two popular beaches in the SF Bay Area (Ocean Beach and Black Sands Beach).

The app pulls data from the following APIs:
- [Magicseaweed](https://magicseaweed.com/) (swell height and weather data)
- [Tide API](https://rapidapi.com/apihood/api/tides) (tide data)

SwellBeta was built in Android Studio using Flutter and Dart, and deployed to a Samsung A20 smartphone.
